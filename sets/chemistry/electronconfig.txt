Zinc full electron configurtion?
1s22s22p63s23p64s23d10

Zinc noble gas configuration
[Ar]4s23d10

Aufbau's principle
lowest energy level fills first

Hunds rule
electrons take own subshell before sharing

pauli exclusion principle: electrons have different "`thing`", if in same subshell they have different `thing2`
thing: address
thing2: spin

Thing that says its impossible to know speed and position of particle at same time
heisenberg uncertainty principle

Atom address: `n`, `l`, `m`, `s`
n: principal
l: angular
m: magnetic
s: spin

Principal meaning
distance from nucleus

Angular meaning
shape of orbital

Magnetic meaning
orientation in space

Hierarchy of shells, orbitals, subshells (top to bottom)
shells
subshells
orbitals
