Wavelength of light: larger = (energy)
lower

Unit of measuring Frequency
Hertzs

Frequency of light: larger = (energy)
higher

Experiment that shows wave description of light
double slit

Energy is made of packets called `name`
name: quanta

Red has `adj` energy, purple has `adj2` energy
adj: less
adj2: more

Lowest energy state of atom?
ground state

Higher energy state of atom?
excited state

When atoms go into higher energy state they `action`, makes `type` spectrum
action: absorb light
type: absorbtion

When atoms go into lower energy state (which they do after going into higher energy state) they `action`, makes `type` spectrum
action: emit light
type: emission

Theory of light?
particle-wave duality

Heisenberg uncertainty principle?
can't know speed and position
