higher

Meaning of λ
wavelength

Meaning of v with a line on it
Frequency

Meaning of c
speed of light

λ is equal to what
c/v

Meaning of h
planck's constant

Meaning of E
energy

E is equal to what

Energy is made of packets called `name`
name: quanta

adj: less
adj2: more

Lowest energy state of atom?
ground state

Higher energy state of atom?
excited state

When atoms go into higher energy state they `action`, makes `type` spectrum
action: absorb light
type: absorbtion

When atoms go into lower energy state (which they do after going into higher energy state) they `action`, makes `type` spectrum
action: emit light
type: emission

Theory of light?
particle-wave duality
