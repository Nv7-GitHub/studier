Ionic bonding makes net charge
0

Ratio is always
simplest whole number

Process where substances become positive (lose electrons)
oxidation

Process where substance become more negative (gain electrons)
reduction

Metallic bonding participants are
metals

Covalent bonding participants are
nonmetals
metalloids

Molecular covalent happens with only
nonmetals

Molecular covalent makes
small stable units

Ionic bonding creates what when dissolved (unlike molecular covalent)
ions

Network covalent made of `shape`, `thing` or `thing2`
shape: grid
thing: nonmetals
thing2: metalloids

Opposites attract force
electrostatic force
